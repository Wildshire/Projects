    "This a two step process.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you train an auto-encoder - not a VAE, just an encoder.\n",
    "The encoder takes an image and project it in the latent space, here we will use a 2 dimension latent space.\n",
    "It is a deterministic computation: the output of the encoder **is not** the parameters of the approximate posterior $q(z|x)$ distribution, it is a point in the $\\mathbb R^2$ space.\n",
    "The decoder reconstruct the input image from the encoder output.\n",
    "Therefore, during training, the main difference is that you don't have a KL divergence term! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we turn this deterministic model into a probabilistic generative model.\n",
    "To do this, we look at where each training image of the training is mapped in the latent space.\n",
    "You can train a Gaussian Mixture Model that will generate data that look like the latent space of the training set!\n",
    "Then, to generate a new data point, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sample a cluster from the GMM: $y \\sim p(y)$\n",
    "2. sample a point from the bivariate Gaussian associated with this cluster: $z \\sim p(z|y)$\n",
    "3. use the decoder to sample an image: $x \\sim p(x | z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To fit and sample from the GMM, use the scikit learn library!\n",
